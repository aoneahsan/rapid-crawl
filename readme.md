Scrape - https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/scrape

Turn any url into clean data

Firecrawl converts web pages into markdown, ideal for LLM applications.

It manages complexities: proxies, caching, rate limits, js-blocked content
Handles dynamic content: dynamic websites, js-rendered sites, PDFs, images
Outputs clean markdown, structured data, screenshots or html.
For details, see the Scrape Endpoint API Reference.

Firecrawl can recursively search through a urls subdomains, and gather the content

Firecrawl efficiently crawls websites to extract comprehensive data while bypassing blockers. The process:

URL Analysis: Scans sitemap and crawls website to identify links
Traversal: Recursively follows links to find all subpages
Scraping: Extracts content from each page, handling JS and rate limits
Output: Converts data to clean markdown or structured format
This ensures thorough data collection from any starting URL.

Map - https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/map

Input a website and get all the urls on the website - extremely fast

The easiest way to go from a single url to a map of the entire website. This is extremely useful for:

When you need to prompt the end-user to choose which links to scrape
Need to quickly know the links on a website
Need to scrape pages of a website that are related to a specific topic (use the search parameter)
Only need to scrape specific pages of a website
​

Search - https://docs.firecrawl.dev/features/search

Choose specific output formats (markdown, HTML, links, screenshots)
Search the web with customizable parameters (location, etc.)
Optionally retrieve content from search results in various formats
Control the number of results and set timeouts
For details, see the Search Endpoint API Reference.
